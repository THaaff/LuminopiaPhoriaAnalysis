ABSTRACT:

Purpose: 
Amblyopia is the most common cause of monocular vision loss in children. Traditional amblyopia therapy has aimed to rebalance abnormalities in cortical development through monocular methods, such as patching therapy. The goal of this study is to investigate the potential for emerging binocular amblyopia therapies in terms of their ability to keep a viewerâ€™s eyes aligned during stimulus presentation.

Methods:
Gaze position was recorded binocularly using an EyeLink 1000. Participants viewed a
randomly ordered series of contrast-adjusted natural animal images (73 x 45 deg) presented
dichoptically at a 60-70 cm viewing distance on a rear-projection screen (PROPixx, VPixx
Technologies). The images were viewed at i) matched binocular RMS contrasts of 15%, 35%,
55%, 75%, 95% & full, ii) the same contrasts monocularly, iii) the same contrasts binocularly
with dichoptic segmentation, iv) full contrast in one eye and the range of contrasts in the other
eye with dichoptic segmentation, resulting in 30 conditions of 10 secs in a continuous trial. The
median gaze position difference between the two eyes was calculated for each condition.

Results:
2 adults participated in this study, both providing eye alignment measurements for each of our 30 viewing conditions. Each adult presented varying degrees of dissociation when viewing the therapeutic segmented condition.

Conclusions:
Measurements of eye alignment when viewing dichoptically segmented stimuli
provide useful information regarding the potential efficacy of new forms of binocular
amblyopia treatments (e.g. Luminopia One therapeutic) for individual patients. These data
highlight the variability in alignment of typical observers and indicate the importance of ocular
motor considerations for the success of these therapies.
